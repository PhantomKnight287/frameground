To use React, we need to set up a React project. A React project takes away all the hassle of setting up a React application from scratch. It provides a pre-configured project structure and all the necessary dependencies to get started with React development. This allows us to focus on building our application instead of worrying about the project setup.


## Steps to Create a New React App:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If not, download and install them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open your terminal or command prompt. You can use the default terminal on your system or any preferred terminal emulator.

3. **Initiating the React App Creation**: Execute the following command to create a new React app:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
   ```

   Replace `my-react-app` with your desired project name.

4. **Move to Project Directory**: Navigate to the newly created project directory using the terminal:

   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**: Navigate to the newly created project directory using the terminal:

   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

   Then, start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch a development server.

7. **Explore and Modify**: You're all set! Begin exploring the generated project structure. The main React components are located in the `src` directory. Customize and build your application by modifying these files based on your requirements.

8. **Further Development**: Utilize the vast ecosystem of React and its libraries to expand your application's functionality. Refer to React's official documentation ([React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)) for in-depth guidance on React concepts, components, and best practices.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a new React app and can now start building your next amazing project using React.


## Challenge

We have already created a new React app for you. Your task is to start the development server and explore the project structure. You can also modify the existing code to see how it affects the application. 

Click the "Run tests" button when you are done with new React app creation and development server setup.

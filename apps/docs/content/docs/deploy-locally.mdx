title: Deploy Locally
description: Deploy locally 
---


This section describes how to deploy the application locally on your machine. You can use it to run your own instance of the application for development and testing purposes.

## Setting up the environment

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
- Install [pnpm, a package manager for Node.js](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack)


## Installing Packages

Install the dependencies for the root project

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Setting up the database

This application uses Postgres as the database. You can install it locally or use a cloud service like [Neon](https://neon.tech/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.io/).

Once you get your connection url add it in the `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

### Running migrations and seeding the database

- Move to `packages/db` directory
```bash
cd packages/db
```

- Run migrations 
```bash
pnpm migrate
```

## Setting Up Github OAuth Keys

[Follow this link](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to create a new app filling the following required details on creation:

```
Homepage URL: http://localhost:3000
Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
```

Once completed, you will be redirected to the application page settings, from there create the client secret by clicking on `Generate a new client secret` button.


Next, copy the client secret generated and the client ID into the .env file, replacing `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>`, respectively:

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
```

## Setting up Next Auth

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="long random string which no one should know"
```

## Running the application

Run the following command in the root directory of the project

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Below is list of ports used by the different services:

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3001
- **Docs** : http://localhost:3002

## Setting up admin user

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and login using Github. Once logged in, move to `packages/db` directory and run the following command:

```bash
pnpm studio
```

This will open the Prisma Studio in your browser. From there you can go to `User` table and in `roles` column add `Admin` to the user you want to make admin.

Now you can access the admin panel at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)



## Populating tracks & challenges in the database

In `packages/db` directory run the following command:

```bash
pnpx tsc && node dist/scripts/index.js
```

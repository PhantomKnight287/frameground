I made this platform for my friends who are quite bad at web dev. This project is nowhere near completion but if you want to contribute then you're welcome.

## Setting Up The Project Locally

> [!NOTE]
> You need to install rust if you want to work on parser or use the parser


1. Setup environment variables
> The `.env.example` can be used as a template to create an `.env` file in the root of the project.

2. Install packages
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

(This Readme isn't complete yet as it lacks things like how to setup db and admin user)
